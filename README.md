# Bank Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to develop and deploy a bank customer churn prediction model. The machine learning algorithms tried include Random Forest, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, and LightGBM. Based on the result of the model evaluation, the XGBoost model is deployed using Streamlit.

The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset).

The model can be accessed from: [Bank Customer Churn Prediction](https://bankcustomerchurnprediction-tktls9icz5srqktv9uhggk.streamlit.app/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2HlhtYm3p9WiEkwWaYA_hMtOfVswLa1oFMuHACphviZp96FqzFTDiLQ3s_aem_AduTIfRMGt1_u_A3_WtO325btXM-Gezhp7kwm8oSohotLXncouUeitDDMpzyUsKY1RGh8Bh1XnR9FY6aL-TQkPEy)
